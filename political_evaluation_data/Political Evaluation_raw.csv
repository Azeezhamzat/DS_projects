On the part of the citizens, lack of trust in the political systems, and the public servants, has led to apathy, especially among youths.  This however  has further complicated outcome of election where massive purchase of vote has become the norm.

Political aspirants must wine and dine with Godfathers and notorious louts, especially among the leaders of the national transport works if they want to win. The consequence of which is the appointment of incompetent cabinet members after election.

Parties lack stable ideologies and principles. So it's a normal for politicians to crosscarpet from one party to another, a save haven when the party weeds the stick.

Also, masses mostly lose trust in the government so quick and thus non compliance of many citizens to policies and unnecessary criticisms from all and sundry distract the government and keep development stagnant or less efficient.

Corruption is a command practice in virtually all sectors if not all household. This is really painful but factual.
