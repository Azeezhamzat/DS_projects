# We will work on the airquality dataset, which contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. This dataset is particularly relevant to environmental sustainability, as it includes measurements like ozone levels, wind speed, temperature, and solar radiation.
# 
# Hereâ€™s the plan for this dataset:
#   Dataset Overview
# 
# Variables:
#   Ozone: Ozone concentration (ppb)
# Solar.R: Solar Radiation (lang)
# Wind: Wind Speed (mph)
# Temp: Temperature (degrees F)
# Month: Month (numeric, May = 5, ..., September = 9)
# Day: Day of the month

# Load the dataset
data(airquality)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(airquality)

# Preview the first few rows
head(airquality)

# Summary statistics
summary(airquality)


# We'll check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
# Checking for missing values
